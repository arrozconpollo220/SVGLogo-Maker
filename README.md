  ## Description
  This is a SVG logo creator. Created and processed through Node.js in your computer's terminal. This application will take you through a series of questions and will create a logo based on the shape (square, triangle and circle), color of the shape and the characters and color you input (up to 3 characters) in a SVG format and save it for you in the examples folder as "logo.svg".

  ## Installation
  To use this application, you would need to install Node.js and download NPM Jest package from the NPM website at https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest

  ## Usage
  To use this application, you will need to go to the "SVGLogo-Maker" file in your GitBash terminal and type in "node index.js". This will bring you to a series of questions, starting off with submitting the characters for your logo (up to 3) if you submit more characters, an error will display stating "You are only allowed to enter upto 3 Characters". Once you submit the proper amount of characters, you will be taken to the next question to select a shape. You will then be provided with 3 options (Circle, Triangle and Square). Once that is selected, the next question will ask what color would you like your shape. After you submit the color, you will be asked what color would you like your text and you can submit that color. Once completed, your terminal will display "Generated logo.svg" and be saved in the "examples" folder.
